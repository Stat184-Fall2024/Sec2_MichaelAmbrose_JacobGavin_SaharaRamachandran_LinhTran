# Analyzing European Energy Production: Wind, Renewable, and Fossil Fuels (2016-2018)

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the European Union's (EU)
energy landscape, driven by efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition 
towards more sustainable energy sources. The EU has increasingly focused on 
expanding renewable energy, such as wind, solar, and hydro, while gradually 
decreasing its reliance on fossil fuels. This shift is evident in the energy 
production data from 2016 to 2018, sourced from Eurostat, which tracks energy 
generation across various sources including conventional thermal, nuclear, 
hydro, wind, solar, and geothermal energy.

Our project aims to explore these changes in the EU's energy production between 
2016 and 2018, identifying key trends and understanding how the energy mix is 
evolving. Specifically, we focus on how the growth of renewable energy sources, 
such as wind and solar, has impacted the overall energy supply and the 
contributions of traditional energy sources. By analyzing this data, we aim to 
answer questions about the sustainability and resilience of the EU’s energy 
sector, the role of different energy sources in meeting demand, and the 
challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the transition to cleaner energy.

## 2. Research Questions

1\. How much do the two sources of energy (renewable and non-renewable) contribute to net production in the EU across 2016-18?

2\. What are the trends and variations in energy production among different renewable sources over 2016-18?

3\. What are the net trade balances for different countries in the EU as of 2018, and how do they compare geographically?

4\. Which EU countries are ranked in the top 5 for the highest and lowest renewable energy production in 2018, and what are their key sources?

5\.  How did the total renewable energy production and imports impact an EU country's net trade balance in 2018?

## 3. Data Description and Provenance

The dataset was sourced from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European
Union, which collects and provides comprehensive and standardized data for EU 
member countries. Eurostat aims to support evidence-based policymaking and 
research across Europe. This dataset focuses on energy production trends, 
examining renewable and non-renewable energy sources, as well as cross-border 
energy flows.

The dataset contains energy production data for European countries from 2016 to 
2018, classified by energy sources such as wind, nuclear, solar, and thermal. 
It provides a basis for examining energy sustainability, shaping policy 
decisions, and understanding the transition to renewable energy.

Data Dictionary:

-   country: Two-letter ISO code for the country

-   country_name: Full name of the country

-   type: Energy production source

-   2016, 2017, 2018: Annual energy production data in Gigawatt hours (GWh)

-   net_production, imports, exports: Metrics on total production and 
cross-border energy flow

The FAIR principles ensure that this dataset is Findable through its clear documentation and structured format from Eurostat. It is Accessible in open formats like .csv and .xlsx, ensuring compatibility with tools like R and Python. The use of standardized units (e.g., Gigawatt hours) and ISO country codes ensures Interoperability across platforms, while its consistent formatting and clear variable descriptions make it Reusable for various analysis, including energy sustainability research.

The CARE principles emphasize Collective Benefit by supporting renewable energy policies that address climate change. Authority to Control is respected by following Eurostat’s guidelines on data use, ensuring ethical and responsible sharing. The dataset promotes Responsibility and Ethics by fostering transparency and sustainable energy practices, benefiting society as a whole.

## 4. Data Wrangling and Cleaning 

To clean the data before it was ready for visualization, a few measures had to be taken, using `dplyr` and `stringr` packages in R. First, rows with a missing value in the 4th column were removed, as they were not suitable to be used for visualization. To make the countries easier to work with, a new column, "country" was created by removing all digits from the country codes, that way only the human readable part was left over. An additional check was performed, that will replace the value of "country" to NA if the length of the value was less than or equal to 1. Fills were then completed on rows without a country code, with the last non-NA value above it. Additionally, columns ...1, ...2, and ...14 through ...18 were removed from the data set, as they were considered extraneous.

Then, the first column is selected for more cleaning. Digits are removed, the substring "of which: " is removed, and periods (".") are removed, and extra whitespace is removed. The data is then stepped through by blocks of 34 rows, corresponding to the start and end rows for each country. columns 1,2, and 3 are converted into rows, and new column ranges are computed. The last two rows are then removed, and a stats list is appended to each row. `glue` is then used to create an excel-style range from the row and column bounds. The column names are set to years, and rows are more narrowly filtered.

The data was structured in a way that adhered to the TIDY principles covered in
class, with one atomic record in a single row. this allowed analysis to be done

      



## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

The original data set was composed of multiple tables, one for each country in the European Union that was being tracked. An example of one such table tracking UK energy production can be seen below.

Given that this data is quite compartmentalized, it makes sense to move the data
into a format that is more easy to operate on, which is how we ended up with the
two new csv data sets.

## 6. Analysis of Research Questions 


#### 1. How much do the two sources of energy (renewable and non-renewable) contribute to net production in the EU across 2016-18?

![Energy Production by Category and Year](../images/energy_category_years.png)

Renewable energy production increased steadily from 1,072,304 GWh in 2016 to 1,156,738 GWh in 2018, 
indicating a gradual shift toward sustainable sources. Non-renewable energy, while dominant, decreased slightly 
from 2,711,571 GWh in 2016 to 2,630,936 GWh in 2018. This reflects their efforts to switch to greener sources of energy. 
Net production remained relatively stable, with 3,751,480 GWh in 2016 and 3,737,693 GWh in 2018. 
Non-renewable energy consistently contributed around 70-72% of total production, while renewable energy accounted for 
approximately 28-30%. This shift shows progress in energy diversification driven by policy initiatives and advancements 
in renewable technologies. However, the dominance of non-renewables reiterates ongoing challenges in fully transitioning 
to sustainable energy production.

####2. What are the trends and variations in energy production among different renewable sources over 2016-18?

![Energy Trends By Source](../images/energy_trends.png)
![Comparing Energy Production by Source](../images/box_plot.png)

The data highlights the production trends and variations across renewable energy sources, namely hydro, solar, and wind. 
The trends show a sharp fluctuation in hydro energy, starting above 620,000 GWh in 2016, with a drop to 580,000 GWh 
in 2017, then rebounding by 2018. Solar energy shows steady growth, from approximately 115,000 GWh 
in 2016 to around 130,000 GWh in 2018. There is also significant growth in wind energy production, starting from approximately 320,000 GWh 
in 2016 and surpassing 400,000 GWh by 2018. The box plot further illustrates variability, showing that hydro has the highest
production levels and variability, with some outliers. Wind follows in terms of production levels but exhibits more consistent 
outputs. Solar remains the smallest contributor among the three despite consistent growth.
These insights show a growing reliance on wind and solar energy, aligning with technological advancements and policy shifts 
toward sustainable sources. Hydro, while the most substantial renewable energy source, demonstrates variability, 
likely influenced by climatic factors like rainfall. Together, these trends highlight the importance of diversifying
renewable energy sources to ensure consistent production levels.

####3. What are the net trade balances for different countries in the EU as of 2018, and how do they compare geographically?

![Net Trade Balances by Country](../images/net_trade_map.png)
![Net Trade Balances- Geographic Distribution](../images/net_trade_country.png)

The visualizations depict the net trade balances of renewable energy among EU countries in 2018. 
The bar chart shows the trade balance in GWh for each country. France, Germany, and Sweden had the highest positive trade 
balances, being significant exporters of renewable energy. Conversely, countries like Italy and Finland had the largest 
negative balances, being heavily reliant on imports to meet energy demands. The map visualization provides a geographic 
perspective, with green regions representing countries with an energy surplus and red regions indicating deficits. Particularly, 
Western and Northern European countries, such as France, Germany, and Sweden, emerge as renewable energy hubs, while Southern 
European countries, including Italy, appear to be more dependent on imports. This reflects the regional disparities in renewable energy
production and consumption. These insights underline the interdependence among EU countries in renewable energy trade and indicate the
collaborative energy strategies used to balance production and consumption.

####4. Which EU countries are ranked in the top 5 for the highest and lowest renewable energy production in 2018, and what are their key sources?

![Top 5- Highest Production](../images/top_5.png)
![Top 5- Lowest Production](../images/bottom_5.png)

The graphs show the inconsistency in renewable energy production among EU countries in 2018. The bar chart for the top 5 
countries with the highest renewable energy production shows that Norway dominates with the largest share, primarily driven 
by hydro energy, followed by Germany, where wind energy contributes the most. Other mentions include France, Spain, and Italy,
with a mix of hydro, solar, and wind energy sources. Conversely, the chart for the lowest producers shows that Malta, Luxembourg,
Hungary, Estonia, and Cyprus generated minimal renewable energy. These countries relied primarily on hydro and wind, with very 
little contribution from solar or geothermal sources. The stark discrepancies between the highest and lowest producers underlines 
the geographic and infrastructural variations in renewable energy potential and adoption. Countries like Norway and Germany 
leverage their natural resources and advanced infrastructure to lead in production, whereas smaller nations like Malta and 
Luxembourg face challenges due to limited resources or geographical constraints. These findings further emphasize the need for 
regional cooperation to bridge the renewable energy gap across the EU.

####5. How did the total renewable energy production and imports impact an EU country's net trade balance in 2018?

![Net Trade balance vs Total Production](../images/corr_net_trade_energy.png)
![Net Trade Balance vs Imports](../images/corr_net_trade_imports.png)

The first scatterplot illustrates a positive correlation of 0.385 between net trade balance and total renewable energy production in 2018. As the production increases, net trade balances also tend to rise, as indicated by the upward-sloping trendline. This suggests that countries with higher renewable energy production are better positioned to generate surplus, or being less reliant on imports, ultimately contributing to a stronger trade balance.  However, the variability in data points indicates that other factors, such as domestic consumption and export policies, also influence net trade balance.
The second scatterplot examines the relationship between net trade balance and imports, showing a negative correlation of -259l. The downward-sloping trendline indicates that higher energy imports are associated with lower or negative net trade balances. This pattern highlights the economic disadvantage of reliance on imports, as it exacerbates a country’s trade deficit.
These visualizations emphasize both the critical role of renewable energy production in bolstering trade balance and the economic challenges posed by energy import dependency. They highlight the importance of policies promoting renewable energy production to enhance trade stability and reduce reliance on external energy sources.
